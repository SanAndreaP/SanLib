###SanLib changes
 - Lexicon does not exist anymore, use **Patchouli** for that instead
 - Networking has changed again: Create a new (```static final```) instance of ```MessageHandler``` and use that to register and send packets. Packets need to inherit ```SimpleMessage``` now. "Low-Level" control is also possible by using the ```SimpleChannel``` instance of the ```MessageHandler```.
 - ```ModelJsonLoader``` has changed: It is now initialized during its construction, before it was during Render reloads. Also vanilla ```ModelRenderer``` does not support naming it anymore, instead I've extended it to ```NamedModelRenderer```. If you have your own implementation of it, I suggest implementing ```ModelBoxBuilder$INamedModelRenderer```
 - The command ```sanlibc``` has been renamed to ```sanlib```, since it is not a client-side command anymore
 - ```ConfigUtils``` and its entire package does not exist anymore, for now, use ```ModConfig``` instead
